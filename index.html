                    leaving this beautiful oxbow lake with central island, it creates the perfect habitat for wildlife
                    to
                    live peacefully whilst allowing us to enjoy watching at a safe distance. Egyption Geese, Crested
                    Grebe and Canadian Geese can be seen all year round and if you're lucky enough to
                    spot a flash of blue, you may just catch sight of the Kingfisher as it looks for its next meal.
                    The endangered Water Vole resides on the river banks mingling with the many varieties of ducks
                    dibbling the weed.</h3>
